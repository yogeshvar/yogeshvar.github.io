  <h1>This is a blog website.</h1>
  
  <p>No animations. No page transitions. No 800kb JavaScript bundle just to say hello. Just words, straight from my head to your screen.</p>

  <h2>Why most blogs feel like a performance</h2>
  
  <p>
    Because they are. You’ve got sites that try to impress with infinite scroll, newsletter popups, tracking scripts, five fonts that don’t even load right, and enough UI glitter to make a disco ball insecure. But underneath all that? Nothing. Just filler content and SEO bait.
  </p>

  <h2>I’ve been around the framework block</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve worked in React, Vue, Angular (1 and its many reincarnations), Svelte, Next.js, Vite, Magento, and even PHP when things got wild. And at the end of the day, all of it did the same thing — render a page. That’s it. One page. One moment of content.
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember once I was tasked with just doing a design revamp — a simple CSS change. That turned into days of figuring out which class to override, which styled component was swallowing the other, and how to unbox a theme baked into a theme baked into another theme. It was like fighting a CSS hydra. You fix one thing, three more break. I still flinch when I see `!important`.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet, every time I start a personal project, I almost fall for it again. Pick a shiny new framework, thinking it’ll help. Instead, I end up with 12 config files and a dev server that sounds like it’s mining crypto. All I wanted to do was write.
  </p>

  <h2>This is different</h2>

  <p>
    This page loads fast because it has nothing to prove. No build step. No bundler. No dark mode toggle (unless you squint). Just me, writing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once I read somewhere that "Simple is the new complex" - some random person on the internet. I don't want to deal with polyfils, 12 config files that I will never use, or bring multiple components to life. I just want to write.
  </p>
