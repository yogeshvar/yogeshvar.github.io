## Introduction: A Lost World

Imagine a time when the Valley of Mexico was a vibrant network of lakes, islands, and settlements, a world teeming with life and rich in mythology. Here arose Tenochtitlan, one of the most remarkable cities of pre-Columbian America. However, the geographies that exist in our minds today often stem from Spanish historical accounts rather than the hydrological realities of ancient times. In this blog post, we’ll embark on a fascinating journey that combines cutting-edge technology with the profound cultural narratives of the Mexica (Aztec) people, revisiting the legend of Aztlan—the mythical homeland of the Mexica—and examining how modern digital elevation modeling can shed new light on an age-old mystery.

## Methodological Marvels: Mapping Ancient Lakes

To navigate the depths of the Valley of Mexico’s past, we turned to digital elevation models (DEMs) to recreate ancient water levels and shorelines. These models are constructed using satellite data from the US Geological Survey's EarthExplorer platform, offering a bird’s-eye view of how the terrain might have looked centuries ago. With a custom JavaScript visualization tool, we can simulate various water levels, revealing possible configurations of the lakes that once dotted the region and exposing ancient settlements that lie hidden beneath centuries of transformation.

For example, at a water level of approximately 2257 meters above sea level, our simulations indicate that significant settlements like Cuicuilco would have thrived alongside the shores, while other islands, such as Huitzilopochco, began to emerge. Such data offers not only a geographical perspective but also hints at potential sacred landscapes that played a vital role in the cultural and spiritual lives of the Mexica.

## The Heart of the Valley: Ancient Settlements and Sacred Sites

Our explorations led us to Santa María Aztahuacan, a site that surprisingly aligns with the legendary Aztlan. But how do we connect this place to the mythic tale? The name itself—meaning "place of herons"—is emblematic; herons are often seen as symbols of spiritual migration and rebirth in Mexica mythology. Our digital elevation modeling suggests that Santa María Aztahuacan emerged as an island in the lush waters that once enveloped the valley, meriting deeper consideration.

Moreover, significant geographies like the Sierra de Guadalupe emerge as embodiments of Coatlicue, the earth mother, reinforcing the divine interplay of locations and mythical narratives. This exploration not only provides geographical insight but also intertwines with rituals historically performed in the vicinity, solidifying these sites' complexities in Mesoamerican spirituality.

## Mapping the Cosmos: An Astronomical Miracle

A defining moment of our research pertains to an extraordinary astronomical event—a solar eclipse witnessed on April 21, 1325. Historical accounts suggest that this eclipse was seen as a divine sign by the Mexica, marking the culmination of their migration and the perfect time to establish Tenochtitlan. By connecting this celestial event with the topography of the valley, we uncover the symbolic importance of location within the Mexica cosmology. After the eclipse, they waited 26 days, which culminated in the sun's zenith passage—an ideal moment for their new city’s foundation.

## The Codex Mendoza: Historical Narratives Revealed

Our journey wouldn't be complete without acknowledging contributions from the **Codex Mendoza**, a treasure trove of pre-Hispanic history. Research has indicated that significant temples, including Tenayuca and Tenochtitlan’s Templo Mayor, are aligned with earthly manifestations that echo celestial patterns. This spatial arrangement reflects Mexica cosmological beliefs and demonstrates that these cultural narratives are deeply intertwined with geographical elements.

Strikingly, the founding date of Tenochtitlan is surrounded by symbols that correspond to a cosmic cycle, hinting at their migration from Aztlan. This intersection of mythology and geography reveals a sacred landscape intricately woven into the Mexica identity.

## Conclusion: Bridging Past and Present

Through the merger of digital elevation modeling and Mexica mytho-history, we gain perspective on Aztlan's potential location and the intricacies of Tenochtitlan's founding. Our insights reaffirm that the past is not merely a narrative of events but a composite of geography, myth, and cultural memory. This interdisciplinary approach shines a light on the sacred significance of locations within Mexica spirituality and addresses the enduring mystery of Aztlan.

As we celebrate the 700th anniversary of Tenochtitlan in 2025, it’s crucial to recognize and honor the complex histories of the valley’s landscapes, where the line between myth and reality blurs, allowing us to reimagine how ancient peoples forged connections between earth, sky, and their sacred beliefs.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Digital elevation models reveal significant insights about ancient landscapes and their cultural importance.
- Santa María Aztahuacan may be a strong candidate for the mythical Aztlan, offering fresh perspectives on Mexica origins.
- The intersection of geography and astronomy played a crucial role in the spiritual lives of the Mexica, particularly during significant events like the 1325 eclipse.
- The narratives contained in historical codices provide critical links to understanding the Mexica worldview, emphasizing the importance of sacred geography.

By shedding light on these historical nuances, we invite readers to develop a deeper appreciation for how ancient civilizations have shaped the landscapes and cultural identities we engage with today.
